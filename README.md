## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5**: Used for structuring the content in a meaningful way.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Utilized for maintaining a consistent color scheme.
- **Flexbox**: Employed for centering the QR code component.
- **CSS Grid**: Used for layout purposes.
- **Mobile-first Workflow**: Ensured the design is responsive and looks good on all devices.
- **Google Fonts**: Integrated for custom typography.

### What I Learned

Working on this project reinforced several important concepts:

1. **Semantic HTML5 Markup**  
   Using semantic elements improved the structure and accessibility of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **CSS Custom Properties**  
   CSS variables were used to maintain a consistent color scheme throughout the project, making it easier to update and manage colors.

3. **Flexbox**  
   Flexbox was used to center the QR code component both horizontally and vertically, simplifying the layout process.

4. **Mobile-first Workflow**  
   Designing with mobile-first principles ensured that the layout is responsive and looks good on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

### Continued Development

To improve my skills, I plan to focus on:

1. **Accessibility**  
   Implementing ARIA roles and attributes to ensure my projects are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

2. **Advanced CSS Techniques**  
   Exploring CSS Grid and animations to create more dynamic and engaging designs, enhancing the user experience.
